        <h3>Hi, I'm Sudarsan Nallathambi 
        </h3>
        <p>
            By day, I manage incidents, problems, SLAs, and KPIsâ€”making sure IT services run smoothly and deliver real value. I enjoy solving challenges, improving processes, and keeping services aligned with expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
            By night (and sometimes weekends ðŸ˜…), I dive into coding projects for funâ€”building small apps, automating workflows, and experimenting with tech. For me, coding isnâ€™t just a skill, itâ€™s a creative outlet that fuels innovation in my service management role too.
